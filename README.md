# Ecommerce Flutter App - GreenTrends

The proposed system is ecommerce platform where people can 
buy plastic free and sustainable products. Customers can place home 
delivery for products. Customers can select desired payment option 
(COD, UPI, NET-Banking).

The proposed system is developed in flutter which helps to create 
cross platform applications with one code base.

# Features of application
‚Ä¢ Customer can dynamically login into the application (When 
customer logins into the app for the first time the state is saved. 
Next time customer opens the app, it won‚Äôt ask for credentials and 
will directly redirect user to home screen).
‚Ä¢ Customer can login through Google (saves email verification time).
‚Ä¢ Customer can login using email. 
‚Ä¢ Application automatically checks if customer email is verified or 
not, If the email is not verified then it sends verification link to 
registered email id. 
‚Ä¢ Customer can login into the app with verified email only.
‚Ä¢ Application automatically creates a used ID and user profile with all 
the user information.
‚Ä¢ In Firebase-Database each and every document, collection, record 
is represented and can be fetched by a unique ID.
‚Ä¢ Customer can place order for multiple products at a time by adding 
them into ‚ÄúCart‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ Customer can add the products which they like into ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù and 
later place an order for them. GreenTrends Application
‚Ä¢ Each and every product sold on GreenTrends is plastic free and 
eco-friendly.
‚Ä¢ Customer directly contributes to nature by buying sustainable 
products and also indirectly contributes to nature by planting trees 
(2% cost of every customer bill will go to GreenTrends tree 
plantation project, so Greentrends will now plant trees on behalf of 
their customer).
‚Ä¢ Customer can also check the products natural resources (Which 
natural resource it is made from, what percentage of natural items 
used).
‚Ä¢ Customers can select desired payment option (COD, UPI, NETBanking).
‚Ä¢ Customer does need to manually add their delivery address, 
application automatically selected and saves the user location after 
customer confirms its pin-code.
‚Ä¢ Customer can place order only if customer details are verified 
(customer name, email, address, phone number). Verification 
process is dynamically carried out by the application itself.
‚Ä¢ After order is placed customer can see their order and its details in 
‚Äúyour orders‚Äù tab inside the application.
‚Ä¢ Customer can check the details they entered in ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù section, 
which details are verified which are not. Customer can also delete 
their account from ‚Äúsettings‚Äù section of application. GreenTrends Application
‚Ä¢ Customers can logout from the app from ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù option in 
application (This kills the dynamic login state).
‚Ä¢ The co-ordination between main application platform 
‚ÄúGreenTrends‚Äù and database ‚ÄúFirebase database‚Äù can be easily 
controlled by Admin Panel ‚Äúadmin application‚Äù. GreenTrends 
customer service can control database with admin application 
without actually reading the database.
‚Ä¢ GreenTrends backend team can add and delete products easily to 
database with Admin application. They can also control orders that 
are placed by user.
‚Ä¢ Admin application has all the necessary information like 
-number of orders
-number of users
-number of categories 
-number of products in database
-number of items sold
-number of items returned
‚Ä¢ All the information in the database can be identified with unique ID 
assigned to it
